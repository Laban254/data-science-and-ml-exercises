### **Model Pipelines in Scikit-learn**

A **Pipeline** is a crucial tool in machine learning workflows that allows you to bundle data preprocessing and model training steps into one cohesive process. By using pipelines, you can ensure that data transformation and modeling steps are done in a sequence, making the workflow more efficient and reproducible.

###  **What is a Pipeline?**

In Scikit-learn, a pipeline allows you to chain multiple steps into a single object. This is especially useful when you need to:

-   Combine preprocessing (like scaling or encoding) with model training.
-   Automate and streamline workflows.
-   Avoid data leakage (where information from the test set is inadvertently used in model training).
